PASER stands for Position Aware Secure and Efficient Mesh Routing and describes a novel efficient secure routing protocol for wireless mesh networks. 
The protocol aims to achieve an acceptable trade-off between security and performance of the routing process in wireless mesh networks. 
The protocol has been designed at the communication networks institute headed by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christian Wietfeld at the TU Dortmund University in Germany.

PASER requires the openssl library. Thus, if you are interested to evaluate it, follow the steps below:
1. Install openssl (a.o., libssl, libssl-dev). Use project properties->omnet++->makemake->options to link it. If you have any questions regarding this issue don't hesitate to send a mail to mohamad.sbeiti@tu-dortmund.de
2. Uncomment #define OPENSSL_IS_LINKED in /src/generic/Configuration.h
3. Recompile inetmanet
4. Run the exmaple: examples/manetrouting/secure_mesh_routing/securerouting.ini
